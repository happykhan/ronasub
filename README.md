# ronasub
Helper scripts for merging and submitting SARSCOV data to  COG

Should include:

* COG submission script.
* Rapid submission script (Lightsub)

Scripts for other databases have been moved to : https://github.com/happykhan/subhelper
e.g. ENA submission script.

# Installation
Python3! 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# NRP2COG

NRP2COG merges disperate Google sheets with various information into a single master table.
The internal modules include: 

* ct_update: Update CT values
* lineage_update: Update Linaege values
* export_lineage: Export Lineage values
* update_metadata: Update metadata
* export_to_server: Export values to external server

For COG and other database submission, the most important modules are update_metadata and ct_update. 

lineage_update is run when there is updates from PEROBA. 

export_lineages are run on request (weekly usually) to feedback contextual data and lineage information.


## Configuration for NRP2COG
These scripts heavily use Google Sheets to track information. You will need your own developer account and you
 will need to have a valid JSON files with all the various keys (see credentials_template.json for an example). 
 
https://console.developers.google.com/project?pli=1

There is usually location and a flag to pass your own path to the config file. If you are contributing to 
the QIB SARSCOV2 get in touch with @happykhan, who can issue the correct keys. 

# METASUB 

Submission scripts that assist with current workflow.

* Identify the samples from a sequencing run. And group according to "plate"
* Choose which plates pass. 
* Then ftp those reads to cog. 
* Then generate metadata sheet. (For Sanger no sample info. Like patient info should be submitted).

## Configuration for COGSUB
You will need the google sheet credentials (as above). You will also need to set up a config JSON file for COG/Majora (see Majora_template.json for an example)

# COGSUB (depreciated, use METASUB)
COGSUB submits the metadata and sequences to COG UK.
